  <h2>Reflections</h2>
	<h4><u>06/20/17</u></h4>
	<p>Some similarites between scratch and python are that you are able to do loops on both of them as well as create variables. Some differences between the two programs was that you had to manually code everything and type everything out instead of just using blocks.</p>
	<p>Debugging my program today was very exhausting and frustrating at first, especially when I couldn't figure out what the problem was. After I fixed it though, I felt good and relived that I was able to fix the problem. The thing I liked about it was the feeling of satisfaction after fixing the issue. Yes, it was hard.</p>
