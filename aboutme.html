  <h2>Coding</h2>
  <h4>Side Scroller Game</h4>
  <img src="C:\Users\Owner\Pictures\1.MHT"style="width:400px;height:350px;">
  <p>Press the right key to move to the right. Press the up key to jump. Try to get the yummy food (pizza, ice cream, cookies, tuna, and donut). Avoid the yucky foods (apple core, crushed soda can, and rotten fish). Jump over puddles and the rat.</p>
  
<h2>Robotics</h2>
	<h4>Circuits</h4>
<p>We created a circuit in class that lit up two lights</p>
	<h4>LED Lights</h4>
	<p>Our Arduino has different two clear lights, two red lights, and one blue light. The clear lights are always on, while the red and blue lights alternate.</p>
  
  <h2>Reflections</h2>
	<h4><u>06/20/17</u></h4>
	<p>Some similarites between scratch and python are that you are able to do loops on both of them as well as create variables. Some differences between the two programs was that you had to manually code everything and type everything out instead of just using blocks.</p>
	<p>Debugging my program today was very exhausting and frustrating at first, especially when I couldn't figure out what the problem was. After I fixed it though, I felt good and relived that I was able to fix the problem. The thing I liked about it was the feeling of satisfaction after fixing the issue. Yes, it was hard.</p>
